# Workday Planner

## Description

This is a workday planner to help you plan and keep track of things you need to do throughout a work day.  The website has a section for each hour in a 9-5 work day to save notes for what you have to do each hour.  This website uses and API to keep track of the current time.  This project helped me learn about adding an API into javascript and also using local storage to save your notes.  

## Usage

CLick on the following link to access the website (https://harrj396.github.io/Jacob-Workday-Planner/)

Once on the website you can click beside the time you would like to leave a note.  Once your note is complete, click the blue button on the right to save your note.
